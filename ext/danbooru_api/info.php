 <br>danbooru API based on documentation from danbooru 1.0 -
 http://attachr.com/7569
 <br>I've only been able to test add_post and find_tags because I use the
 old danbooru firefox extension for firefox 1.5
 <p>Functions currently implemented:
 <ul>
 <li>add_post - title and rating are currently ignored because shimmie does not support them
 <li>find_posts - sort of works, filename is returned as the original filename and probably won't help when it comes to actually downloading it
 <li>find_tags - id, name, and after_id all work but the tags parameter is ignored just like danbooru 1.0 ignores it
 </ul>

CHANGELOG
13-OCT-08 8:00PM CST - JJS
Bugfix - Properly escape source attribute

17-SEP-08 10:00PM CST - JJS
Bugfix for changed page name checker in PageRequestEvent

13-APR-08 10:00PM CST - JJS
Properly escape the tags returned in find_tags and find_posts - Caught by ATravelingGeek
Updated extension info to be a bit more clear about its purpose
Deleted add_comment code as it didn't do anything anyway

01-MAR-08 7:00PM CST - JJS
Rewrote to make it compatible with Shimmie trunk again (r723 at least)
It may or may not support the new file handling stuff correctly, I'm only testing with images and the danbooru uploader for firefox

21-OCT-07 9:07PM CST - JJS
Turns out I actually did need to implement the new parameter names
for danbooru api v1.8.1. Now danbooruup should work when used with /api/danbooru/post/create.xml
Also correctly redirects the url provided by danbooruup in the event
of a duplicate image.

19-OCT-07 4:46PM CST - JJS
Add compatibility with danbooru api v1.8.1 style urls
for find_posts and add_post. NOTE: This does not implement
the changes to the parameter names, it is simply a
workaround for the latest danbooruup firefox extension.
Completely compatibility will probably involve a rewrite with a different URL
